# To-Do-List-App
Built a To-Do List Android application using **Kotlin, XML and Android Studio** and **Room** to store data in local storage.
With the help of this app, user can track all its tasks and to-dos efficiently.
We can add a task with its **tittle, priority**. A user can **remove** any task on its completion.
Different priorities can be distinguished with the help of **red, yellow and green color** for **high, medium** and **low priority**.
**Sorting** can be done based on the priority of the tasks. A user can also **Search** any task from its title.
